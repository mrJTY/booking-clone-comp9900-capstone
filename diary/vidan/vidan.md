# Week 3
- Entire week's focus primarily on the immediate deliverable; the project proposal report
- Added / contributed to the user stories, software architecture diagrams, user interface mockups and created the program flowchart
- Got started on various aspects of coding, primarily focused on frontend - UI framework, navigation, routing, login/logout/register

# Week 4
- Final revision and submission of the report with the team
- More brainstorming regarding "novel" feature implementation, which I had suggested a form of social connectivity with the followers feature set
- Further work on the next deliverable which is the first presentation; primarily code integration with a focus on the frontend - that is, login/logout/register working, creating a simple listing card & state persistence

# Week 5
- Written the report on Retrospective A
- Frontend work on 'mylistings' which show all of the primary user's listings, along with integrations of API endpoints and UI framework
- Overall frontend UI revamp with navigation, and singular 'listing' pages

# Week 6
- Continuation of ensuring listings are appropriately rendered
- Link a 'ResourceCard' to a listing (showing all availabilities) + resource owner's user profile
- Frontend implementation of availabilities using datetime logic & validation
- Brainstorming & assistance on the 'search' functionality
