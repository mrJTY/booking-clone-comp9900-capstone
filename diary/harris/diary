Harris Phan's diary (z3415157)

Week 1
Group is formed and we were trying to look for one more member to no avail. Github and Jira accounts were created. Started off using Amazon amplify with Justin starting it all off
thanks to Justin.

Week 2
Justin implemented tasks for Jira and I got to work on all of my sectins, which included the design draft doc (the proposal). Got started on the design doc Got to work on creating the hashing for the password. 
No password should be exposed in a POST statement, which is what happened. During the team meeting on Tuesday, the tutor said they needed to be able to execute the code on their end as
well, which means we reverted to a flask setup instead of an AWS setup which was full cloud. Docker would be used for the container.

Week 3
Started doing the proposal, especially on the user stories part. Looked at the Jira backlog for all the list of possible user stories. Made descriptions on the user stories, looked at examples.
Discussed with the team more potential use cases for the project, such as the followed and followers implementation and the NLP-based one. Proposal is now finished. 

Week 4
Created update and delete (CRUD) for the resource listings. User now has the ability to update and delete listings. 
Learnt how to create unit tests for the listings, especially for update and delete. This way we know that we are on the right track.

Week 5
Went through extensive meetings, and now Blue Sprint 2 is finished (see Jira). Presented the Demonstration in that week with the first 2 user stories and showed that it was done 
to Iwan. Then implemented a basic resource search function which returns the keywords for the listing name and its description.
