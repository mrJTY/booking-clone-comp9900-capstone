# Saksham's Diary (z5164624)

# Week 1
- Harris and I decided we were interested in BookIt project
- We found 2 other group members to form a group with(Vidan & Justin)
- Started brainstorming ideas and discussed the software we would use
- Joined Slack channel for discussion 
- Started preparing 

# Week 2
- Joined Jira and Github
- We had to decide between two possible options - either use a cloud service like AWS, or run locally using Flask/Django
- Started brainstorming ideas for the recommendation engine and NLP feedback functionality for the project proposal 
- Joined group discussions with my team to discuss roadblocks and possible solutions. 

# Week 3
- Wrote up my section for the project proposal (recommender engine and NLP feedback) 
- We decided to use Flask instead of AWS as the tutor said they had to be able to run our code on their end  
- Started doing research around how I would implement the recommender engine 

# Week 4
- Submitted project proposal 
- Learned to create test cases
- Successfully wrote and tested some test cases for inserting and updating users into our database

# Week 5
- I was assigned with generating fake data for users and bookings 
- Researched 20 different venues across 4 categories and wrote them to a csv file 
- At the end of the Sprint meeting, I was assigned with making sure that users can only book a maximum of 10 hours per month

# Week 6
- Wrote code in the generate_fake_data.py file which reads data from the aforementioned csv file and inserts into database
- Wrote code to assign each of the bookings to a random user. 
- Continued working on recommender engine, especially brainstorming which features to use and how the system would work
